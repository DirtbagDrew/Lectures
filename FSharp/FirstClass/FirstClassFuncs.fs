// As inner functions:
let getAdder baseVal =
    let adder x =
        baseVal + x
    adder

// Examine the type of getAdder: int -> (int -> int)
// getAdder returns a function that takes an int and returns an int...
// but how is the return value of that function calculated? It uses baseVal's value
// when getAdder is actually invoked. That is a DYNAMIC value that is not known until
// runtime, so the behavior of the resulting function won't be known until runtime. 


// To use it:
let addBy5 = getAdder 5
addBy5 10 |> printfn "5 + 10 = %d"

// Calling getAdder multiple times will result in multiple copies of "adder" being
// created, each with a different value of "baseVal".
let addBy100 = getAdder 100
addBy100 10 |> printfn "100 + 10 = %d"


// This may be troubling... how does it POSSIBLY work?
